        In this digital world, we are easily distracted.
        Information is everywhere and we feel the need to
        deal with increasing and multiple forms of information.
        It drags on our time and our attention.
        The inability to concentrate on the task at hand
        is one of the maladies of our time — everyone wants to

        your concentration skill by doing  simple exercises
